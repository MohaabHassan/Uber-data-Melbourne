Data wrangling of dirty uber rides in Melbourne
The data files contain all the files required to run ipynb notebook. 
The data consists of three types of errors which has been corrected systematically in the notebook,
1] Syntactical anomalies
2] Semantic anomalies
3] Coverage anomalies(missing values and outliers)

I have wrangled the data upto maximum efficiency by cleaning 96% of the errors.
The solution files contains all the cleaned data after running the ipynb.
